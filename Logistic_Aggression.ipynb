        " - **Logistic Regression** is a statistical model used for binary classification, which means it predicts a categorical outcome that can take on one of two values (e.g., yes/no, true/false, 0/1). It's often used when you want to model the probability of a certain event occurring.\n",
        " - The key difference lies in the type of outcome variable they predict. Linear Regression is for continuous outcomes, while Logistic Regression is for categorical outcomes [1]. Logistic Regression uses a sigmoid function to transform the output of the linear equation into a probability between 0 and 1, which is then used to classify the outcome."
